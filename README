gls is a graphical version of ls.

It graphically displays files which are specified by operands on a terminal. If
a operand is a directory then it displays files in the directory.  If no
operand is specified then it displays files in the current working directory
such as ls.

It uses w3m to display images on a terminal and gls.scm requires Gauche.
 w3m: <http://w3m.sourceforge.net/index.en.html>
 Gauche: <http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index.html>

The following options are available:
 -l   Display images as large size
 -m   Display images as middle size
 -s   Display images as small size

Install:
 Intalling gls is just copying both gls and gls.scm to a directory where the
 PATH environment variable contains.
